                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this assignment is to create a web page
                    that dynamically generates and displays random text using
                    jQuery. This involves designing a structured layout,
                    implementing JavaScript functionalitity to append generated
                    text to the output div upon button click, and debugging
                    issues to ensure the page works correctly both locally and
                    on the server. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Problems">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>The only problem I had was my css wasn't showing up. I had
                    the stylesheet linked and it wasn't updtating my page no
                    matter what I did. I eventually copy and pasted my HTML
                    from an old lab and that worked. Im not sure why it worked
                    but the problem was solved. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Reflection">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Overall the lab was pretty straight forward and I didnt have
                    any challenges other than my css not working. 
                </p>
