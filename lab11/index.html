            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The challenge of this assignment is to create an
                organized HTML page with linked CSS and JS files, use
                javascript to manipulate arrays with map() and callback
                functions, and output results in the console.
            </p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>The only "problem" I had was I got stuck trying to output my
                results because I didn't read the instructions fully. I did
                what I was supposed to but I didn't read the part that said the
                results will show in the console. It was a good laugh when I
                figured it out tho.
            </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Overall it was a breeze and I had fun thinking about the
                different kinds of functions I could make.
            </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Check console to see results</p>
            <input  type="text" id="inputname" placeholder="Input your name">
            <button id="submit">Submit</button>
            <div id="output"></div>
