            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The challenge of this assignment is to create a structured web
                page that integrates a JavaScript implementation of the 
                "FizzBuzz" function, styled with custom CSS, and dynamically
                outputs results to a webpage using jQuery. It involves writing
                a JavaScript function to handle the FizzBuzz logic with
                multiple conditions (3, 5, 7), appending results to the DOM,
                and debugging issues to ensure functionality both locally and
                on the server.
            </p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I didn't really have any problems with this lab. Following the
                lecture which showed how to make the fuction, it was easy to
                implement in the lab.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Overall, the lab went smoothly. It was interesting seeing how
                much the extra credit option changes the overall look of the
                web page and the code. If I had more time, I think I would
                enjoy implementing that aswell.
