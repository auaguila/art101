            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The challenge of this assignment is to create a web page that
                fetches and displays data from the XKCD API, allowing users to
                view the lates comic and navigate through previous and next
                comics using AJAX, while managing proper button states and
                handling erros effectively. 
            </p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I initially struggled with the URL not working due to CORS
                restriction, which prevented the API call from fetching the
                data properly. After troubleshooting and using a proxy service,
                I was able to fix the issue and retrieve the comic data.
            </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This lab was a good balance of challenge and learning. It wasn't
                too easy, bit it also wasn't overly difficult, and it helped me
                better understand working with APIs, handling CORS issues, and
                using AJAX for dynamic content. Overall, it was a good
                experience that improved my problem solving and debugging
                skills.
