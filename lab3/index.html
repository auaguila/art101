					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this assignment is to build a homepage
						and a lab page using HTML, add images and links to
						previous labs, and make sure everything fuctions
						locally before uploading the project to GitHub.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When working with my partner, we encountered a problem
						with pushing our changes to github. It stated we had no
						internet connection when we did. We tried restarting
						our devices and using a hotspot, however that didnt
						work. So we decided to wait a day to see if that would
						help.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall the assignment when well and even though I
						didn't have enough time to get creative, I still put in
						a lot of effort into this lab. I had a lot of fun going
						through the hexcodes to get the right shades of green
						and trying to troubleshoot our issues.</p>
