			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode & Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to develop pseudocoding
						skills by outlining both an everyday task and simple
						computer game, then turning the pseudocode into
						JavaScript comments. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didnt really have any problems with this lab. The only
						"issue" I somewhat have is the formating in the html
						for the Pseudocode in the precode line. But that was
						just more of an annoyance than an issue.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went pretty well. It was fairly simple
						and I enjoyed figuring out the steps for the computer
						game and everyday tasks with my partner.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<h3>Pseudocode for everyday tasks</h3>
						<p>Baking Conchas<br>Get 3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour,
							½ cup + 2 tbs white sugar, 7.5 grams instant dry
							yeast, ½ tsps salt, ½ cup butter, 100 ml eggs,1
							tsps vanilla, ½ cup milk<br>½ cup + 1 tsps 
							vegetable shortening, 100 grams confectioner sugar,
							5 grams cocoa powder <br>Mix all dry ingredients 
							(3 ¾ cups all purpose flour, ½ cup + 2 tbs white
							sugar, ½ tsps salt,) in bowl and mix well<br>Add 
							butter and mix <br>Add your eggs, and vanilla,
							and mix until you reach a dough consistency<br>Keep
							mixing for a while<br>After 10ish minutes, you will
							have a soft texture (somewhat sticky)<br>Kneed your
							dough and shape into a ball-like shape<br>Get a 
							bowl covered in grease, put dough in, and let rest
							for 2 hours with plastic wrap<br>Preheat oven to
							325<br>Let dough rise in a warm place like the top
							of a stove<br>Make toppings -> Mix vegetable 
							shorting in a bowl until creamy<br>Add confectioner
							sugar and a bit of flour so it doesn't get too
							sticky<br>Add your flavor powder (coco powder)<br>
							Mix ingredients well and set aside<br>Once it is
							ready, divide the dough into smaller balls<br>Put
							the dough into a greased pan with space in between
							each ball.<br>Flatten out the topping and make
							strips to put on top of top of the dough<br>Have
							fun with it, maybe cut the strips<br>Let rise a bit
							more then put in the oven for 2 hours<br>Then put
							them in the oven for 15-20 minutes<br>Then get a
							gold consistency on the top, edges, or bottom<br>
							Then when they turn golden, take them out of the
							oven, and DONE

					<h3>Pseudocode for simple computer game</h3>
					<pre><code>//print a 17x15 checkerboard
//while snake == alive
	//randomize x,y (spot on board)
		//print apple
	//if snake eats apple
		//increse snake length by 1
	//if snake runs into wall or lands on self
		//snake == dead
