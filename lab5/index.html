				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of the lab is to practice working with
					javascript variables and data types by declaring,
					referencing, and outputting them through the console and
					HTML. The lab icludes debugging and testing to make sure
					everything works correctly on the web server.</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I didn't really have problems with this lab, it was pretty
					straight-forward. I struggled to pick a color for the
					lowrider, but that was the only "issue" I had.
				</p>
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This lab went really well and really fast. I had a lot of
					fun looking into my favorite car and finding out so much
					about it. I love lowriders so anytime I could bring them up
					or look at them, its great.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Program Execution:</p>
