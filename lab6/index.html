				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of the lab is to create and manipulate
					javascript arrays and objects by declaring a list of
					transportation methods and an object for a primary vehicle,
					dispaying them in the console and on a webpage. 
				</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I didn't have problems with this lab, it was pretty
					straight-forward.
				</p>
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This lab went really well and really fast. It's always
					interesting playing around with the console.
				</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Program Execution:</p>
