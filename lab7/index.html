					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this assignment is to create a
                        javascript function that promots the user for their
                        name, sorts the letters alphabetically, and returns the
                        sorted name. The function's result is then displayed
                        neatly on a webpage using document.writeln().
                    </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only issue I had at first was I wrote out the
                        function exactly like how it was in the screenshot in
                        the assignment on canvas. Then I just changed the code
                        to how I would write it and it worked.
                    </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall it was really easy for me and didn't take much
                        effort. However, I did have fun explaining the concepts
                        to my partner and helping her with the lab.</p>
