            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The challenge of this assignment is to create an
                organized HTML page with linked CSS and JS files, use
                javascript to manipulate arrays with map() and callback
                functions, and output results in the console.
            </p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>The only "problem" I had was I forgot how to declare an 
                array for a second. But then I remembered and the
                assignment was pretty straight forward from there.
            </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Overall it was a breeze and I had fun thinking about the
                different kinds of functions I could make.
            </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Check console to see results</p>
