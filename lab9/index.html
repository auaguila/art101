                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this assignment is to practice building a
                    well-structerd webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with
                    jQuery to create interactibe features, style elements
                    dynamically, and debug code effectively.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Problems">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>We ran into some syntax problems and some issues making the
                    button to actually worked. For a while, you could click but
                    nothing would happen. Then we found that the problem was in
                    the css. It was fun to play with the colors afterward.

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Overall, it taught us a lot about jQuery functionalities and adding interactive elements in JavaScript.
